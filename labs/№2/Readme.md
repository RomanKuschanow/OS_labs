2. Дайте визначення наступним поняттям:
>Готував студент Путін М.Г.
  - CLI-режим 
    - `CLI-mode`: CLI stands for "Command Line Interface," which is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with a computer system through typed text commands. CLI-mode refers to a state or mode in which a computer system is operating solely through this type of interface, with no graphical user interface (GUI) components visible. CLI-mode is often used in server administration, software development, and other technical tasks that require fine-grained control over system processes.
  - Термінал на основі графічного інтерфейсу користувача
    - `Terminal based on the graphical user interface`: A terminal is a program that allows users to access a command-line interface on a computer system. In a graphical user interface (GUI) environment, a terminal program can be used to provide a CLI-mode experience within a window or other graphical element. This type of terminal is often referred to as a "terminal emulator," since it emulates the behavior of a traditional hardware terminal (which was a physical device used to communicate with computer systems in the early days of computing). Terminal programs may offer additional features such as tabs, color coding, and copy/paste functionality.
  - Віртуальний термінал
    - `Virtual terminal`: A virtual terminal (VT) is a software interface that allows multiple text-mode sessions to run concurrently on a computer system. Each virtual terminal can be thought of as a separate CLI-mode environment, with its own login prompt, command history, and other features. Virtual terminals are often used in Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, where they provide a way for multiple users to access a shared system without interfering with each other's work. In a GUI environment, virtual terminals can be accessed through a terminal emulator program, as described above.

    There are several different Unix/Linux shells available, each with its own set of features and characteristics. Here is a brief comparison of some of the     most popular ones:

      - `Bourne shell (sh)`: This is the original Unix shell, developed by Stephen Bourne in the 1970s. It is a simple, text-based shell that does not have many     advanced features. It is often used for scripting and automation.

      - `C shell (csh)`: This shell was developed by Bill Joy in the late 1970s as an alternative to the Bourne shell. It has a C-like syntax and some additional     features, such as command-line editing and history. However, it is not as widely used as some of the other shells.

      - `Bourne-Again shell (bash)`: This is the default shell on most Linux distributions. It is based on the Bourne shell but adds many advanced features, such     as command-line editing, history, programmable tab completion, and shell scripting. It is highly customizable and widely used.

      - `Tcsh`: This shell is an enhanced version of the C shell, with additional features such as command-line editing, history, and job control. It is popular     among users who prefer a C-like syntax and advanced features.

      - `Korn shell (ksh)`: This shell was developed by David Korn in the 1980s as an alternative to the Bourne shell. It combines the features of the Bourne         shell and the C shell, and adds some advanced features such as command-line editing, history, and job control. It is highly customizable and widely used.

      - `Zsh`: This shell was developed in the 1990s as an alternative to bash. It is highly customizable and includes many advanced features such as command-       line editing, history, programmable tab completion, and advanced globbing. It is popular among power users and developers.
    
    3. Для чого потрібен менеджер пакетів. Які менеджери пакетів ви знаєте у Linux?
    
    A `package manager` is a tool used to manage the installation, upgrading, and removal of software packages in a computer system. It simplifies the process of installing and managing software by automating tasks such as dependency resolution and version management.

    In Linux, there are several package managers available, including:

      - `Advanced Packaging Tool (APT)`: This is the default package manager used in Debian-based Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu and Debian. It is a command-line tool that can manage software packages from local repositories or from the internet.

      - `Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM)`: This is the default package manager used in Red Hat-based Linux distributions, such as CentOS and Fedora. It is a command-line tool that can manage software packages from local repositories or from the internet.

      - `Pacman`: This is the package manager used in Arch Linux. It is a command-line tool that can manage software packages from local repositories or from the internet.

      - `Zypper`: This is the default package manager used in SUSE Linux. It is a command-line tool that can manage software packages from local repositories or from the internet.

      - `Portage`: This is the package manager used in Gentoo Linux. It is a command-line tool that can manage software packages from local repositories or from the internet.

      - `Snap`: This is a package manager used in Ubuntu and other Linux distributions. It is designed to work with containerized applications and can manage packages from a central store, which are installed in a sandboxed environment.

      - `Flatpak`: This is a package manager used in several Linux distributions. It is designed to work with containerized applications and can manage packages from a central store, which are installed in a sandboxed environment.
    
    4. Які засоби безпеки використовуються в Linux?
    
    Linux is well-known for its security features and has been designed with security in mind from the ground up. Here are some of the key security features of Linux:

      - `User and group permissions`: Linux has a robust user and group permission system that restricts access to files and system resources. Each file and directory has a set of permissions that control who can read, write, and execute them.

      - `Firewall`: Linux has a built-in firewall called iptables, which can be used to restrict network traffic to and from the system.

      - `Security modules`: Linux has several built-in security modules, including SELinux and AppArmor, which can be used to restrict the actions of individual processes and applications.

      - `Encrypted filesystems`: Linux supports several encryption technologies, including dm-crypt, which can be used to encrypt entire filesystems, protecting data even if the system is stolen or compromised.

      - `Package management`: Linux package managers, such as APT and YUM, use digital signatures to ensure that packages are authentic and have not been tampered with.

      - `Sandboxing`: Linux supports containerization and virtualization technologies, such as Docker and KVM, which can be used to run applications and services in isolated environments.

      - `Regular updates`: Linux distributions provide regular security updates to address known vulnerabilities and protect against new threats.

      - `Auditd`: Linux includes the auditd daemon, which can be used to monitor system activity and provide an audit trail of actions taken on the system.

      - `Secure boot`: Linux supports secure boot, which ensures that the system boots only with trusted bootloaders and kernel images.
    
   5. Чому використання віртуалізації зараз стало таким актуальним?
    
   The use of virtualization has become more relevant in recent years for several reasons:

      - `Server Consolidation`: Many organizations have hundreds or thousands of servers, each dedicated to a specific application or task. This can be expensive to maintain, and often results in underutilized resources. By using virtualization, multiple virtual machines (VMs) can be hosted on a single physical server, leading to better utilization of resources and cost savings.

      - `Agility`: Virtualization allows organizations to quickly spin up new VMs and test new applications and services without the need for additional physical hardware. This can lead to faster deployment times and improved time-to-market for new products and services.

      - `Disaster Recovery`: Virtualization makes it easier to create backups of entire VMs, including the operating system, applications, and data. In the event of a disaster or hardware failure, these backups can be quickly restored to another physical host or to the cloud.

      - `Security`: Virtualization allows organizations to create isolated environments for specific applications or services, reducing the risk of security breaches and improving overall system security.

      - `Cloud Computing`: Virtualization is a key technology behind cloud computing, which has become increasingly popular in recent years. Cloud providers use virtualization to offer scalable and flexible computing resources to their customers, which can be easily provisioned and deprovisioned as needed.
    
    6. Як ви розумієте поняття контейнеризації?
    
    `Containerization` is a technology that allows running isolated environments on a single physical server. Containers are lightweight and portable, allowing applications to be packaged with all their dependencies and libraries, and run consistently across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

    Containers use operating system-level virtualization to isolate the application and its dependencies from the underlying infrastructure. This means that a container runs on the host operating system and shares the same kernel, but has its own file system, network stack, and other system resources.
    
    7. Які переваги/недоліки використання програмного забезпечення з відкритим кодом?
    
    Open source software refers to software whose source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using open source software:

    `Advantages`:
      - `Cost`: Open source software is often free to use, distribute, and modify, which can result in significant cost savings for individuals and organizations.

      - `Flexibility`: Open source software can be modified and customized to meet specific needs, making it more flexible than proprietary software.

      - `Security`: With open source software, anyone can review the code for vulnerabilities and contribute fixes, which can result in faster identification and resolution of security issues.

      - `Reliability`: Open source software is often developed collaboratively by a community of developers and users, which can result in higher quality and more reliable software.

      - `Innovation`: Open source software allows anyone to contribute to the development and improvement of software, which can result in more rapid innovation.

    `Disadvantages`:

      - `Support`: Open source software often lacks the same level of professional support that proprietary software offers, which can make it difficult to get help when issues arise.

      - `Compatibility`: Some open source software may not be compatible with proprietary software or other systems, which can limit its usefulness in certain environments.

      - `Complexity`: Open source software can be more complex to use and configure than proprietary software, which may require more time and resources to learn and implement.

      - `Documentation`: Open source software may not have the same level of documentation and user guides that proprietary software offers, which can make it more difficult to learn and use.

      - `Fragmentation`: With so many different open source projects available, there can be fragmentation and duplication of effort, which can result in a lack of cohesion and standards across different projects.
    
    8. Скільки активних віртуальних консолей (терміналів) може бути у процесі роботи Linux по
    замовчуванню. Як їх викликати та між ними перемикатися? Наведіть приклади?
    
    By default, most Linux distributions have six active virtual consoles or terminals available for use. These virtual consoles are accessed by pressing the Ctrl+Alt+F1 through Ctrl+Alt+F6 keys on the keyboard, with each key combination corresponding to a different virtual console. To switch between virtual consoles, you simply press the key combination for the console you want to switch to. For example, pressing Ctrl+Alt+F2 will switch to the second virtual console.

    Here are some examples of how to call and switch between virtual consoles in Linux:

      - To switch to the second virtual console, press Ctrl+Alt+F2.
      - To switch back to the first virtual console, press Ctrl+Alt+F1.
      - To switch to the third virtual console, press Ctrl+Alt+F3.
      - To switch to the fourth virtual console, press Ctrl+Alt+F4.
      - To switch to the fifth virtual console, press Ctrl+Alt+F5.
      - To switch to the sixth virtual console, press Ctrl+Alt+F6.
      
    Once you switch to a virtual console, you can log in with your username and password to start using the command line interface.

    Virtual consoles are useful for troubleshooting and debugging Linux systems, as they provide a way to access the system directly and independently of the graphical user interface. They are also helpful in situations where the GUI is not available or not functioning properly.

    9. Яка віртуальна консоль (термінал) виконує функцію графічної оболонки?
    
    The virtual console that serves as a graphical shell in Linux systems depends on the display manager that is used.

    On most Linux distributions, the default display manager is the X Display Manager (XDM), which runs on the seventh virtual console (Ctrl+Alt+F7) and launches the graphical user interface (GUI) when you log in. However, some Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint, use the LightDM display manager, which also runs on the seventh virtual console.

    Other display managers, such as GDM, SDDM, and KDM, may use a different virtual console for the GUI, so it's important to consult the documentation or online resources for the specific distribution you are using to determine which virtual console is used for the graphical shell.
    
    10. Чи можлива реєстрація в системі Linux декілька разів під одним і тим же системним ім’ям? Які
    переваги це може надати?
    
    In a Linux system, it is not possible to register multiple user accounts with the same system name. Each user account must have a unique name in the system.

    Having multiple user accounts with the same name could cause confusion and make it difficult to manage permissions and access control, as the system would not be able to distinguish between different users with the same name.

    However, it is possible to have multiple user accounts that share the same UID (user ID) in the system. This is called a "shared user account". With a shared user account, multiple users can log in to the system with the same account credentials, but each user will have their own unique home directory and profile settings.

    One advantage of using a shared user account is that it can simplify the management of access control and permissions, as all users with the same UID will have the same level of access to files and directories in the system. This can be useful in environments where multiple users need to access the same resources or work on the same projects. However, it is important to use caution when using shared user accounts, as it can also make it more difficult to track user activity and determine who made changes to files and directories.
    
>Висновок:
In the course of the laboratory work, we studied the Linux operating system, and more specifically its specific distribution - Ubuntu, and theoretically investigated in more detail the issue of system management through the graphical user interface. We gained practical skills in working with commands in the terminal, setting up a mobile OS, and Ubuntu
